# JetBrains Theme â€“ Shadowborn
Personal theme for JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, etc.) with a *Solo Leveling* theme, named after the Season 2 insert song [*Shadowborn*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6xMg5CzJLI).

Adapted from my [VSCode Shadowborn Theme](https://github.com/RyzenFromFire/vscode-shadowborn), created with the help of [mswift42's Theme Creator](https://github.com/mswift42/themecreator).

## Usage
- Install Gerry's Themes and use "Gerry Violet" (or use any other dark black/purple theme of your choice).
- Override the theme's Editor Color Scheme with Shadowborn's by importing the `.icls` file from this repository.
